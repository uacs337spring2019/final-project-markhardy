Wiki Vanilla

This app is a database of items used in the first expansion
of World of Warcraft from 2005-2006 which is soon to be
re-released. The SQL database is populated with data
from private servers users have maintained to emulate
the game.

Searches will display corresponding items. Clicking on
an item will bring up its page. If the item is dropped
by a creature in the game, information on that creature
will be listed in a table.

The main item stat window contains stats about the item.
The color of the item's name depends on its quality.

To use it..

Type in the name of an item. If you don't know any,
here are some suggestions..

Mantle of the Blackwing Cabal -> shows a shoulder item
which has a title in purple (epic quality) and the 
creature that drops it which is Razorgore the Untamed.

Thug Pants -> legs item in gray color (common quality).
Not dropped by a creature.

Earthshaker -> Purple epic quality weapon droppped by Magmadar.


Searching for an item currently works but I will be adding many
more features over the summer and hopefully have a fully functional
on the web shortly!
